# k4term

A terminal emulator built on Ghostty's VT core and Zed's GPUI, and the house
terminal of the [k4 bar](https://github.com/k4ditano/k4) — though it does not
need it: without a bar in front, the bridge stays quiet and you get a plain,
fast terminal.

## Credit where it is due

This is **not** a from-scratch stack. The embedding work underneath — the Zig
build and C ABI over Ghostty's terminal core, the safe Rust wrapper, and the
GPUI `TerminalView` with its input, selection and rendering glue — comes from
[Xuanwo's `gpui-ghostty`](https://github.com/Xuanwo/gpui-ghostty), Apache-2.0,
whose copyright notice this repository keeps in `LICENSE`. k4term is what got
built on top: the two applications, the k4 bridge, and the additions to the
embedding layer that they needed.

The stack it inherits is minimal, pinned and testable:

- VT parsing/state: Ghostty's terminal core (vendored as a submodule)
- Rendering/UI: GPUI (from Zed), with a custom renderer (no Ghostty renderer reuse)

## The two binaries

On top of that stack this repo ships the terminal itself, in two binaries that
are the same session seen two ways:

- `apps/k4term`: the window. GPUI, the house font, live theming from the k4 bar.
- `apps/k4term-isla`: the same session minus the window. It serves the grid as
  JSON lines on stdout and takes keys on stdin, which is how the bar embeds a
  real terminal inside its island. The bar starts it on its own, so it has to
  be on `PATH`.

Install both, plus the icon and the desktop entry, into your home — no sudo,
nothing that collides with distro packages:

```sh
./instalar              # build in release and copy the binaries
./instalar --enlace     # symlink to target/release instead (for development)
./instalar --sin-shell  # skip the shell integration
./instalar --quitar     # undo it
```

Shell integration goes in automatically, into every shell it has a script for
whose rc file exists — not just `$SHELL`, because having your login shell in
one and your terminal in another is normal, and doing only one leaves it half
done. It is one marked block, it backs up what it replaces to `*.k4.bak`, it is
idempotent, and `--quitar` takes it out and leaves the file byte-identical.

Without it k4term still works, but the bar cannot know which command is running
or how long it has been going: that is the shell talking OSC.

The icon is drawn, not shipped as a blob: `python3 assets/icono.py` renders
every size from `assets/icono.py` itself. `assets/referencia.png` is the
generated design it was traced from.

With the k4 bar installed you also get `SUPER + Shift + T` (the session in the
island) and `SUPER + Alt + T` (pop it out into a window, in whatever directory
it was left).

## Workspace Layout

- `crates/ghostty_vt_sys`: Zig build + C ABI for the Ghostty VT core
- `crates/ghostty_vt`: safe Rust wrapper over the C ABI
- `crates/gpui_ghostty_terminal`: GPUI `TerminalView` + input/selection/rendering glue
- `examples/vt_dump`: feed bytes into VT and print the viewport
- `examples/basic_terminal`: minimal GPUI view that renders a `TerminalSession`
- `examples/pty_terminal`: login shell PTY wired to `TerminalView`
- `examples/split_pty_terminal`: two PTYs in split panes

## Version Pinning

- Ghostty is vendored at `vendor/ghostty` and pinned to tag `v1.2.3`.
- Zig is pinned to `0.14.1` (required to build the vendored Ghostty core).
- GPUI is consumed from Zed pinned to commit `6016d0b8c6a22e586158d3b6f810b3cebb136118`.

## Build Prerequisites

1. Initialize submodules:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

2. Install Zig (pinned) into `.context/zig/zig`:

```sh
./scripts/bootstrap-zig.sh
```

3. Build and test:

```sh
cargo test
```

Notes:

- `crates/ghostty_vt_sys` requires `zig`. If `zig` is not in `PATH`, it will use `.context/zig/zig`.
- You can also set `ZIG=/path/to/zig` to override discovery.

## Running Examples

VT dump:

```sh
printf '\033[31mred\033[0m\n' | cargo run -p vt_dump
```

GPUI demos:

```sh
cargo run -p basic_terminal
cargo run -p pty_terminal
cargo run -p split_pty_terminal
```

## Public API (gpui_ghostty_terminal)

Crate root re-exports the stable entry points:

- `TerminalConfig`
- `TerminalSession`
- `default_terminal_font`, `default_terminal_font_features`
- `view::{TerminalView, TerminalInput, Copy, Paste, SelectAll}`

Embed-friendly options:

- Disable window title updates (useful when embedding into a host app that owns titles):

```rust
use gpui_ghostty_terminal::TerminalConfig;

let config = TerminalConfig {
    update_window_title: false,
    ..TerminalConfig::default()
};
```

## Compatibility Notes

This implementation includes common terminal behaviors needed by modern TUIs:

- DSR replies (`CSI 5n` / `CSI 6n`) for cursor position/status queries
- OSC title tracking (OSC 0/2), OSC 52 clipboard write
- OSC 10/11 default foreground/background queries
- SGR mouse modes + scrollback navigation bindings
- IME composition support (commit + preedit overlay)
- DEC Special Graphics (ACS line drawing) + box drawing (procedural quads)

The examples set `TERM=xterm-256color` and `COLORTERM=truecolor` to help apps enable richer output.
